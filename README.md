Project Arcos!

Background and Relevant Information:

In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. However, this has led to widespread misuse of both prescription and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that they could indeed be highly addictive. The current opioid epidemic is partly due to pain relievers being the gateway for addiction of harder drugs, such as heroin and fentanyl, leading to more than 17,000 prescription opioid overdose deaths in 1999 - 2017. In fact, prescription opioid has caused even more overdose deaths than synthetic narcotics prior to 2016. 

Project Objectives:

It is undoubtedly an important public health concern to investigate factors relating to overdose deaths in the United States. Our project tries to do so from a new perspective: traditionally, analysis has focused on the addicts (e.g. their race, income, and age group), but recent lawsuits involving Purdue Pharma and other manufacturers has highlighted the possible role of distributors in trying to overprescribe opioids for profit. The Post has already reported on exorbitant numbers of pills per person for some counties (over 100 pills per person per year). We wanted to continue investigating whether more prescriptions, higher doses, number of manufacturers/distributors, number of pharmacies, or market share of these distributors are related to death rates and other negative socio-economic phenomena (e.g lower income, higher demand on rehabilitation programs and high drug-related crimes) in each county. This could inspire possible policies to tackle the crisis (e.g. cap market share, reduce the number of distributors or pharmacies).
